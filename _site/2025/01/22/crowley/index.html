Crowley has a night sect chart as the sun is below the horizon. He has Leo rising with the sun in their fall in libra, his third house. we see here that the topics of the 3rd house are important to his health and security as well as his very being. with a fallen sun we could expect sorrow and difficulties from this point of life, a feeling of not being seen. We also find the benefic of sect Venus in the 3rd. she is under the beams but in her own bounds and domicile, this is known as being in ones chariot. There too is the feeling of being unseen when a planet is under the beams; like a part of life that isn't as recognizable to the native, yet still she is in her own Egyptian bounds and domicile. she is able to assert herself strongly. it is as if she is drudging up hidden sights from the underworld itself! Venus too rules the sign of Taurus so she imports significations from that house to the 3rd. There is a strong connection between communications and career. Again asserting her ability to bring up from the hidden places, the underworld in the myth of Inanna, to the most public area of life. Suiting for an occultist that brought ceremonial magick into the public eye! The occult was once only for wealthy priests and secret societies. Crowley was born 2 days before an eclipse which is regarded as a mark of eminence or importance. we can also expect eclipses to have a greater effect on him through his life. 

<br /><br />

Examining the sect light, the moon, we see her in the succedent 8th house, in a nocturnal sign, waxing, ruled by the benefic Jupiter, in the bounds of mars, and her triplicity rulers are Mars, Venus, and the moon herself. We find mars exalted in Capricorn, his 6th house. mars is in their joy in the 6th but it is still a cadent house. Venus likewise is in a cadent house. typically with two of the sect lights triplicity lords in cadent houses we would expect one to have a grueling and difficult life but both planets are highly dignified which eases their assault on Crowley's existence. He struggled with many bouts of ill health throughout his life, some that the doctors declared as fatal - but somehow managed to recover. he also struggled with addictions his entire life while having to work almost non-stop to upkeep his magickal disciplines and livelihood especially when his inheritance ran out. To what degree of success ill leave an open question. We can also inspect the pre-natal syzygy for significations of life, this was a new moon on sep. 29th in libra leading the triplicity lords to be mercury, Saturn, and Jupiter. we find all 3 of them angular with Saturn in his own domicile leading us to suspect that the 2nd half of life may be better though certainly not easy as he is still the counter sect malefic. 

<br /> <br />

<h2> the houses </h2>
<br />
<p>The 2nd house of Virgo is ruled by mercury in the 4th house Scorpio. the 2nd house is exoterically ones finances and how they are made, esoterically its the inner body, ones organs and the upkeep of the organs. diet, things one needs to be healthy, worldly possessions. it is the gate of hades after all, both the entrance and exit to the underworld, a hidden and mysterious place. we see here  a connection between possessions and foundations, a connection between money and the home. Crowley spent much of his time writing, practicing, and reading from his large library at home. The 4th house is the most private and secret aspect of ones chart and can indicate hidden matters and in this case hidden things are important to Crowley's finances. 
<br /><br />
in the 4th house of Scorpio we find its ruler in the 6th; an exalted mars in Capricorn. there is a connection between his foundations and hard work. Which indeed he spent many sleepless nights writing, doing ritual and engaging in wanton hedonism. funnily enough the ruler of the 6th is in the 7th of relationships. his many "scarlet women" and otherwise. <br /> Scorpio is a mysterious and inward looking water sign that the ancients also associated with hidden matters, the genitals, thievery - and its in this house we find both Jupiter and mercury. Jupiter is importing 5th and 8th house matters, creativity, death, and inheritance. The 4th is also ones parents, especially the father - and its from his father he received a massive inheritance in his youth. He used this money to spread his philosophy and religion across the world, his creative output like book publishing and of course drugs and sex(decided 5th house topics) Mercury imports finances and community, reaffirming his use of funds to spread his message. <br /> Mercury will be stationing retrograde in his chart within 7 days of birth and preparing to make a heliacal set(becoming hidden under the rays of the sun and no longer appearing in the western sky) this is considered to be a great burst of energy with the station but a general weakening overtime - but this once again reasserts the importance of hidden things. the 4th house can also be about endings and death which indeed his work and writing heavily centers around. In his written ritual instruction "Liber HHH" he gives many meditations on death. </p> <br />

 <br /> 
 <p>This is but one of numerous examples of a mystical relationships with death, the subsequent rebirth, and hidden things. A true exposition would fill tomes- and that is exactly what he did. 
 <br /><br />
 Crowley placed a high importance on his relationships with women in his life but ultimately left them ruined and in despair -a theme we see repeating through out his life. so its appropriate that we find his 7th house ruled by Saturn with Saturn in their own place. A powerful Saturn but still the malefic out of sect, they are receiving a superior trine from Venus and square from Jupiter which both lessen Saturn's capability to inflict difficulty but none-the less his relationships were short lasting and greatly damaging to them as well as himself and his reputation.
 <br /><br />
 The 8th house is Pisces ruled by Jupiter in the 4th. his lot of fortune is here suggesting luck in matters of shared finance, death, and inheritance. The moon is also here, being the luminary of sect she has a strong influence on the inner nature of Crowley. She is receiving an exact sextile from mars and making a close sextile to Pluto' both minor aspects but bringing both planets greater signification to his life. It is curious that the next aspect the moon makes in her course is a sextile with Saturn - this also shows increasing importance of Saturn in his life. Any short reading of Crowley would be inundated with saturnian symbolism such as BABALON, <a href="http://www.thelemapedia.org/index.php/Scarlet_Woman"> the scarlet women </a> and matters too lengthy to go into here. 
  <br /> The moon being in the 8th and her close aspect with Pluto again reaffirms the importance of the symbolism of death and the mysteries of sexual union.  
 <br /><br />
 The 9th house is Aries, ruled by an exalted mars in the 6th. He has his MC point and the north node here signifying an importance of philosophy, spirituality and religion in his career. being ruled by mars it repeats the signification of hard laborious work, something that any serious study requires. Crowley's ability to stay up for days on end writing became great boons to his career. He claims in <i>Liber DCCXI Energized Enthusiasm</i>  <br /> "I wrote “Tannhauser,” complete from conception to execution, in sixty-seven consecutive hours. I was unconscious of the fall of nights and days, even after stopping; nor was there any reaction of fatigue. This work was written when I was twenty-four years old, immediately on the completion of an orgie which would normally have tired me out." <br /> <br />
