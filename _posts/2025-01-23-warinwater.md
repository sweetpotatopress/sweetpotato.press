<h2>war in water we invoke: mars in cancer</h2>
<br>
<p>
My breast burns with irritation the water rushes forward with no irrigation its war on the spirit that rips inside my sweet delight. what doors must open; the water rushing breaks all in sight. the psyche burns; underworld cries tonight the spirit dies! cancer you crab, you armored mother, you well of desire! changing by day ravishing by night mars sits strong there is no end to this blight. emotions run, my mind perspires, another desire expired. mars you god of war! you red fire you attack every mire! Walls arise to come down again your eyes unblinking wash aware in piercing fire. Steam and smoke yet still it lights, burning, bright. Hatred stirs inside; dire. crying, wailing the next is calm yet another wave comes and wipes clean all good for irritating power. My heart beats for you my mind wanders how does one live within the sea of blood red sin. the moon! she cries with fire in her eyes the earth looks back in surprise. Tonight riding swift knives arise to pierce the sky again blood rains without cover backwards running star we feel your ire. <br> <br>

Yet what can we do but love, love your endless attacks bring to mind sweet peach under teeth -rushing sugar meat. my stomach, it yearns. my stomach, it burns. for you! mars, cancer. god of war in chariot flying over power glares quick. Dissolve my gaze in your mixed rage let me dive deep into the abyss your opposites create. <br> <br>

On earth I'm here your body quakes what movements do you make? quick, fast, slow, die. Wash away, don't cry. stop wishing its time to lie the swords will raise, dive, plunge blood. I bleed for you in gasoline dreams burning liquid reams . stop! Feel the seams. Give up! fall this heart beats fine so pierce again the beating muscle dolls. Surgery cut the indescribable bustle of crowds alight burn bright <br> <br>

My voice is low can you hear, we stay soft attack bite cry body dies pour your life into a cup wash away what once was up. On earth we sweat; each drop brings death. Design look to the sky see me bright. Now we stand in body right the birth of the world the death of the child my stomach craves the nectar of righteous sign beside her. we will fight, love and cry. we look inside bright night departs to day sun shining light washes over me we take flight. <br> <br>
